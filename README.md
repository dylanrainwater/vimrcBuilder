## Why

Building a vimrc file should not be difficult. **You're configuring a code editor that was invented in 1991** after all. No-matter your experience level, there are always new ways to alter your vim experience, yet finding the commands to do so can be impossible as tips are scattered across the internet.

<br>
Having a vimrc is nearly critical if it's your primary text editor. Certain things should have just been built in, but they are not.

Example: `syntax on` in your vimrc enables syntax highlighting

`syntax on` and many more options are available for usage in the live web-app linked below.

## Usage

## Contributing

#### Install

```sh
npm run newb
```

<br>

#### HowTo

Edit content in `/src` and build with grunt. Consider leaving a `grunt watch` process in another window during your development.

As grunt builds the `/dist` directory, you will see updates by running `node index.js` from `/` and `open http://localhost:3000` in your browser. LiveReload is not configured, so manual page reloads in browser are required.
